## For developers
1. Folders and items in `myproject` folder contain code that has been tested and prepared for release
  meaning that they're being deployed to the server each time the `./reinit.sh` is being run
2. Folders `Frontend` and `Backend` outside the `myproject` folder are meant for preproduction code 
  uploads and testing, back-end and front-end devs upload their code there, which on @The-Magicians-Code's
  approval make into the production environment (`myproject` folder), which he then integrates into the
  server
